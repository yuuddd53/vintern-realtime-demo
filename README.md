## Overview

The Vintern 1B model is designed for efficient image recognition. It is capable of processing images in real time, allowing users to integrate it into various applications. This repository provides a simple way to set up and use the model on your local machine.

## Recommended Setup

To run the Vintern model effectively, follow these guidelines:

- **CPU**: At least 8 cores
- **RAM**: Minimum of 8GB
- **Internet**: Required only for the initial model download

You can find the original model [here](https://huggingface.co/5CD-AI/Vintern-1B-v3_5).

After the first run, the model will work offline.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Vintern model on your computer:

1. **Install llama.cpp**: Start by installing the llama.cpp library. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp).

2. **Run the Server**: Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   llama-server -hf ngxson/Vintern-1B-v3_5-GGUF --chat-template vicuna
   ```
   - If you are using an NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPU, you may need to add `-ngl 99` to activate it.

3. **Open the Application**: Launch `index.html` in your web browser. Alternatively, you can access the demo using this link: [Vintern Realtime Demo](https://github.ngxson.com/vintern-realtime-demo/).

4. **Optional Customization**: You can modify the instructions, such as changing the output format to JSON instead of descriptions.

5. **Start the Process**: Click on "Start" to begin using the model.

## How to Use

Using the Vintern model is straightforward. Once you have set up the server and opened the application, you can start processing images. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the interface to upload an image for recognition.
2. **View Results**: The model will analyze the image and provide recognition results in real time.
3. **Adjust Parameters**: If needed, adjust the parameters to refine the output.

This model is designed to be user-friendly. You can easily switch between different tasks or image types without extensive configuration.

## Customizing the Model

The Vintern model allows for some customization to fit your specific needs. Here are a few options:

- **Output Format**: Change the response format to suit your application. For instance, you can request the model to return data in JSON format instead of a descriptive text.
  
- **Model Parameters**: You can adjust parameters like sensitivity and recognition thresholds to improve accuracy based on your use case.

- **Testing with Other Models**: Explore other models available in the llama.cpp library. You can find a list of these models [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/multimodal.md).
